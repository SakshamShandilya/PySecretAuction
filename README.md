- This project is a Python-based implementation of a secret auction program. 
- The program enables users to conduct a secret auction, where bidders submit their bids without knowing the other bidders' offers. The highest bidder at the end of the auction wins the item or service being auctioned.

## Getting Started

- To get started with the project, you need to have Python  installed on your computer.
You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

- Once you have Python installed, clone this repository to your local machine:

                            git clone https://github.com/your-username/secret-auction.git

## How to Use
- To run the program, navigate to the cloned repository's directory and execute the secret_auction.py file with Python:

                             cd secret-auction
                             python secret_auction.py
                            
- The program will prompt you to enter the name of the item or service being auctioned and the number of bidders participating in the auction. Once you have entered this information, the program will prompt you to enter the names of the bidders and their bids.

- After all bids have been entered, the program will reveal the winning bidder and the amount of their bid.
